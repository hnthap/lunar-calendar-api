# Lunar Calendar API

The Lunar Calendar API is built using the astromonical formulae from *Astronomical Algorithms* by Jean Meeus, 1998 and Ho Ngoc Duc's [Lunar calendar calculator](https://www.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/~duc/amlich/JavaScript/).

## Usage

To start the API server at `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

To run tests:

```bash
npm install
npm run test
```

PORT value can be specify in the file `.env` (replace `3000` with another available port value):

```
PORT=3000
```

## API

### Convert Gregorian date to Lunar calendar

Method: `GET`

URL: `/convert`

Parameters:

* `source`: Original date's calendar. Must set to `Gregorian`.
* `target`: Target date's calendar. Must set to `Lunar`.
* `y`: The year. For example, AD 1 is 1, AD 2024 is 2024, 1 BC is 0, 10 BC is -9.
* `m`: The month of the year, from 1 to 12.
* `d`: The day of the month, from 1 to 31.
* `z`: Time zone offset in hours. For example +09:00 is 9, -10:00 is -10, 00:00 is 0.

Return: JSON object of the equivalent date in Lunar calendar.

Example: To convert the Gregorian date July 19th, 2024 in time zone +07:00 to Lunar calendar,

```
GET /convert?source=Gregorian&target=Lunar&y=2024&m=7&d=19&z=7
```

This should send:

```json
{
    "year": 2024,
    "month": 6,
    "leap": false,
    "day": 14
}
```

which means July 19th, 2024 is the day 14, month 6 (not leap) in Lunar calender (approximately in AD 2024).

### Convert Lunar date to Gregorian calendar

Method: `GET`

URL: `/convert`

Parameters:

* `source`: Original date's calendar. Must set to `Lunar`.
* `target`: Target date's calendar. Must set to `Gregorian`.
* `y`: The approximate Gregorian year of the Lunar year (which means most of the Lunar year falls in this Gregorian year).
* `m`: The month of the year, from 1 to 12.
* `leap`: Whether the month is leap, is `true` of `false`.
* `d`: The day of the month, from 1 to 30.
* `z`: Time zone offset in hours. For example +09:00 is 9, -10:00 is -10, 00:00 is 0.

Return: JSON object of the equivalent date in Lunar calendar.

Example: To convert the Lunar date: day 15, month 8 (not leap), approximately in AD 2024, in time zone +07:00, to Lunar calendar,

```
GET /convert?source=Lunar&target=Gregorian&y=2024&m=8&leap=false&d=15&z=7
```

This should send:

```json
{
    "year": 2024,
    "month": 9,
    "day": 17
}
```

which means the Lunar date falls in September 17th, 2024 (Gregorian calendar).
